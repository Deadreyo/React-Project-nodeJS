- Create a folder named "Folder". This folder will be the source from which the JSON file will be created.

- Inside that "Folder" folder, put the Course's folder. NOTE: You should only have one folder at a time inside "Folder".
Only the first folder in there will have a JSON file made for.

- You can make a folder called "Folder-old", in which you can save or prepare other course's folders.


- Open Command Prompt, navigate to the folder in which this text file is in.

- Then write "node hirarchy". This command will create the files "hirarchy.json" & may also create "hirarchy-backup.json"
    - hirarchy.json file will have the hierarchy of the folder inside "Folder" saved as JSON format.
    - hirarchy-backup.json file will be the previous copy of "hirarchy.json", so it is like a temporary backup.

- Then write "node links". This command will create the files "LINKS.json" & may also create "LINKS-backup.json"
    - LINKS.json file will have the hierarchy of the folder inside "Folder" saved as JSON format too, but with the addition of "link" line added after each "name".
    - Change the second "link" to be the link of the file on Google Drive.
        Example: {
            "name": "ThisIsATest",
            "link": "www.google.com/link/whatever/test"
        }
    - LINKS-backup.json file will be the previous copy of "LINKS.json", so it is like a temporary backup.

@ Note: "node links" will save any links already written before if the file name was not changed. So it is safe to update without needing
to re-write all the links. Also, LINKS-backup.json is helpful in case of any mistakes being made.

- After filling the links inside "LINK.json", write "node combine". This will combine hirarchy.json with LINK.json
    - Produces "combined.json" & "combined-backup.json". This is the final form of the JSON file in a readable format.
    - Also produces a file with the course name (the name of the first folder inside "Folder") inside "dist" folder. This is the @target folder that we need.

- After quickly glancing over "combined.json" and seeing it is correctly made, send me the @target file, through Whatsapp.


@ Note: Arabic Names are NOT allowed.

@ Note: Any files or folders which have the suffix " - 19" or " - 20", etc.
    will have that suffix deleted from the name, but will have property "date" set to that number.
    This is used by the website to organize files by year.
    Example: "Exams - 19.pdf" will be automatically renamed to "Exams.pdf", and will be displayed under Year 2019
    on the website.

@ Note: Any .txt files with the prefix "note" will be removed, but will add a comment to the folder it is in.
    Example: a file named "note1.txt" will be replaced with a comment that contains the .txt file contents and displayed on the website.

@ Warning: Special characters and symbols like '&' are NOT allowed.
